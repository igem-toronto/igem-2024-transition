    Antibiotic Resistance has slowly risen to become one of the biggest health crises of our time, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually [1]. However, this issue extends beyond medical consequences, affecting global development and undermining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for greater health, economic growth, and inequality; it also further exacerbates gender disparity and poverty. Antibiotic resistance is not merely a clinical challenge but also reflects systemic failure in healthcare, socioeconomic inequality, and inadequate government [1].

    Addressing this multifaceted issue requires a solution that goes beyond conventional methods. Plasmid AI represents the use of innovative technology to address antibiotic resistance. While we have developed functional plasmids, our current focus is on laying the groundwork for future applications.

    Central to our approach is the understanding that scientific innovation thrives with a people-centered approach. Our Human Practices journey emphasizes that scientific innovation cannot thrive without the voices of the communities we aim to serve. We have engaged with and incorporated feedback from diverse stakeholders to ensure that our project has a holistic perspective and our solution resonates with real-life experiences and needs. This year, our community engagement project AImersion has allowed us to understand the cultural contexts that surround community perspectives.

    Building on the efforts of iGEM Toronto’s 2023 Human Practices team, our team has taken a more streamlined approach to inclusivity. We have conducted an impact assessment, focused on understanding whether our projects impact on indigenous communities.

We acknowledge the rapid evolution of AI and its integral role in our project. To responsibly harness this new technology, we have developed a tailored framework, incorporating elements from three existing models. Our approach   emphasizes ethical AI usage, transparency, community engagement, and a comprehensive risk assessment to ensure safety.

   In light of the current ecological crisis, we have conducted a thorough impact analysis, tracking our carbon footprint. In collaboration with an Associate Engineer from the Ministry of Environment, we have developed a plan to reduce our carbon footprint if our project is scaled up. This strategy ensures our project addresses antibiotic resistance while being sustainable.

    We understand the importance of inspiring individuals through synthetic biology. This year, we hosted a seminar for incoming freshmen to share our project and showcase the exciting possibilities that synthetic biology offers. We made sure to be transparent about our methods, giving attendees a clear understanding of our research. To spark meaningful discussions, we held a debate exploring the ethical side of what we do. Right now, we are teaming up with the Science Communication Club to write an article on antibiotic resistance. These efforts show our commitment to engaging various communities and raising awareness about the real-world impact of synthetic biology on health and society.

    Our stakeholder framework was designed to ensure that there is a safe space for expressing assorted opinions. We recognize that though certain modifications might be challenging to implement, our goal is to find a middle ground that balances stakeholder satisfaction with feasibility.

  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve this, we designed a five-part approach:

  </p>


    {{sub subheading("1. Identification of Key Stakeholders")}}
    <p>Our first step in our holistic approach was to map stakeholders into specific sectors. This process helped ensure that we consider diverse viewpoints essential for the success of our project. We identified the following sectors:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Engaging with healthcare professionals to understand the implications of antibiotic resistance in a medical field, we also aimed to explore existing treatment methods as well as medical benchmarks for new solutions.</li>

        <li><strong>History:</strong> Reaching out to historians to gather insights on how past medical advances have influenced public perceptions of healthcare inventions. Our aim was to understand how previous innovations, along with colonial legacies and historical inequalities, shape contemporary attitudes towards medical inventions today.</li>

        <li><strong>Bioethics:</strong> Consulting with bioethics experts to address safety and regulatory considerations of our project, such as the potential for dual use.</li>

        <li><strong>Community:</strong> Connecting with community members to gather diverse perspectives on AI integration into synthetic biology. We aim to promote inclusivity by understanding different viewpoints and have encouraged individuals to also share their stories that led to this viewpoint to explore the cultural contexts that shape these perspectives. This approach helps us create a more holistic understanding of community values and concerns related to our project.</li>

        <li><strong>Indigenous Communities:</strong> While we intended to engage with Indigenous communities to understand their perspectives on AI in healthcare and antibiotic resistance, we faced challenges in connecting with relevant organizations. Despite these hurdles, we acknowledge the importance of engaging with vulnerable communities. We have done a preliminary impact assessment to identify the connection between our project and the health concerns of Indigenous populations. Moving forward, we remain committed to continuing our efforts to contact and collaborate with Indigenous communities.</li>

        <li><strong>Environmental Sector:</strong> Reaching out to environmental experts to assess the ecological impacts of our project and how we can reduce our carbon footprint if our project were to scale up, to ensure that our project is sustainable and eco-friendly.</li>

        <li><strong>Bioethics (Duplicate):</strong> Engaging with bioethicists to ensure the safety of our project, to navigate the moral implications of our project ensuring our approach is respectful and moral.</li>

        <li><strong>Academia:</strong> Contacting academic researchers specializing in antibiotic resistance and related fields to enhance our scientific approach. This helped ground our project in rigorous research.</li>
    </ul>

    {{sub subheading("2. Impact Assessment")}}
    <p>Our next step was conducting an impact assessment focused on Indigenous communities. In Canada, the past continues to shape the present in profound ways. Historical trauma— including mistreatment, forced family separation, land dispossession, and cultural suppression—has had lasting effects on the physical and mental health of Indigenous populations [2]. These intergenerational harms have been widely documented and emphasize the need for approaches that are grounded in respect and understanding.</p>

    <p>With this in mind, we conducted an impact assessment focused on ensuring our project impacts Indigenous communities before initiating outreach. Our assessment involved reviewing recent scholarly articles to identify how antibiotic resistance impacts Indigenous populations. Our goal was to foster respectful, informed partnerships without perpetuating harm or exploitation.</p>

    {{sub subheading("3. Stakeholder Engagement")}}
    <p>Two-way communication with diverse stakeholders has been central to our project. Initially, we reached out to professionals through perceptual questions to understand their perspectives. We followed up with questions to gather insights from their respective fields as well. This helped us identify critical areas that needed attention in our project.</p>

    <p>For community engagement, we launched the AImerion project, which allowed community members to express their perspectives through art and storytelling. This created an interactive platform where communities can express their perspectives in a safe space. We also reached out to the community through public forums to understand vaccine hesitance. Additionally, we explored public perspectives on the commercialization of our project, to shape the long-term goals of Plasmid AI. These initiatives have helped us ensure that our stakeholders have been co-creators in shaping our solution.</p>

    {{subsubheading("4. Feedback Integration")}}
    <p>We designed our feedback integration process to ensure that stakeholder input directly informs and shapes our project. By collecting feedback through various channels such as art, interviews, and feedback forms, we aimed to capture diverse perspectives and concerns. Analyzing this feedback has helped us to identify key themes and insights that we have incorporated into different aspects of Plasmid AI.</p>

    {{subsubheading("5. Continuous Monitoring")}}
    <p>Continuous Monitoring is essential to our approach, allowing us to assess the impact of our initiative and allowing open lines of communication with stakeholders. We have scheduled follow-up meetings in October to share how we have integrated the feedback we received. During these meetings, we will ask our stakeholders if they are satisfied with the integration and discuss any additional concerns or suggestions they may have. This ongoing dialogue ensures that our project remains responsive to community needs and fosters a collaborative environment.</p>
