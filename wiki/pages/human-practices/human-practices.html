    Antibiotic Resistance has slowly risen to become one of the biggest health crises of our time, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually [1]. However, this issue extends beyond medical consequences, affecting global development and undermining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for greater health, economic growth, and inequality; it also further exacerbates gender disparity and poverty. Antibiotic resistance is not merely a clinical challenge but also reflects systemic failure in healthcare, socioeconomic inequality, and inadequate government [1].
