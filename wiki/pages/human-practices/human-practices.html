    Antibiotic Resistance has slowly risen to become one of the biggest health crises of our time, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually [1]. However, this issue extends beyond medical consequences, affecting global development and undermining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for greater health, economic growth, and inequality; it also further exacerbates gender disparity and poverty. Antibiotic resistance is not merely a clinical challenge but also reflects systemic failure in healthcare, socioeconomic inequality, and inadequate government [1].

    Addressing this multifaceted issue requires a solution that goes beyond conventional methods. Plasmid AI represents the use of innovative technology to address antibiotic resistance. While we have developed functional plasmids, our current focus is on laying the groundwork for future applications.
