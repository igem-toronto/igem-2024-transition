{{subheading("Defining Our Application")}}
<div>
  <p>
  Our journey in Integrated Human Practices began with a critical examination of the pressing issues our technology could address, marking a step in the development of Plasmid AI as a foundational advance in synthetic biology. We explored significant environmental challenges such as bioremediation and wastewater management, as well as opportunities to improve gut microbiome therapy, biofuel generation, conservation efforts, agricultural practices, and antibiotic resistance.

 </p>

 <p>
Through extensive background research and engaging conversations with stakeholders, we identified antibiotic resistance as an urgent global health threat that our technology could lay the groundwork for to tackle in the future. The following section dives into the background research and conversations we had with stakeholders, explaining why we chose to focus on antibiotic resistance (ABR) for Plasmid AI.

</p>

{{subsubheading("Bioremediation and Waste Water Management")}}

<div>

  <p>
  One of the applications our research focused on, was bioremediation and wastewater management, critical areas that blend environmental sustainability with synthetic biology. We explored using microbes to degrade harmful pollutants in wastewater, emphasizing the importance of Horizontal Gene Transfer, which enables bacteria to acquire genes for enhanced degradation. However, wastewater treatment plants can also facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, creating both opportunities and challenges [1][2].

    </p>

  <p>
Although genetically engineered microbes show promise, gaps in models predicting gene transfer permissivity exist, highlighting an area our project could address. The economic implications are significant, with implementation costs ranging from $200,000 to over $4 million [3][4]. Despite their potential benefits, bioremediation methods require optimization for scalability [5][6]. To deepen our insights, we consulted with an Associate Engineer from the Ministry of Environment.

  </p>

  
</div>

{{subsubheading("Conservation")}}

<div>

<p>
  The emerald ash borer (EAB), an invasive beetle from Asia, poses a significant threat to North American ash trees, leading to rapid tree death and an estimated loss of 2 billion trees in Canada over the next two decades [8]. Current management primarily involves the costly application of insecticides, which can be toxic to non-target organisms[9].

  </p>
<p>
Our project considered leveraging RNA interference (RNAi) as an innovative pest management strategy. RNAi targets specific genes in EAB to induce mortality, with the potential to use machine learning for optimizing the design of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) plasmids. Application methods such as foliar sprays and trunk injections were explored to deliver the dsRNA effectively [10][11].
  </p>
  <p>
Ultimately, we decided not to pursue this approach due to the complexities of dsRNA production, potential environmental impacts, and the need for extensive optimization before practical application could be realized. Our focus shifted toward other solutions that better align with our project goals and capabilities.
    </p>
</div>

{{subsubheading("Gut Microbiome Therapy")}}

<div>

  <p>
  Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a significant global mental health challenge, with growing evidence linking gut microbiota dysbiosis to its pathogenesis [12]. Alterations in microbial diversity and specific bacterial taxa, particularly increases in pro-inflammatory bacteria and decreases in anti-inflammatory ones, have been observed in MDD patients. Key affected phyla include Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, suggesting that dysbiosis may exacerbate MDD symptoms [13]. Various microbiota-targeted therapeutics—such as dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics—show potential in alleviating depressive symptoms, though further research is needed to validate their clinical application [14].
    </p>
  <p>
Despite the promising therapeutic avenues, we chose not to pursue gut microbiome therapy for MDD due to the complexities of gut-brain interactions and the need for extensive research to establish causality between microbial composition and MDD. Additionally, the variations in individual responses to microbial-targeted therapies and concerns regarding the safety of live probiotics in vulnerable populations led us to focus on other, more straightforward therapeutic strategies that align better with our project objectives [15].
    </p>

</div>

{{subsubheading("Agriculture")}}

<div>
  <p>
  Agriculture has seen transformative advancements through artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology. AI applications encompass crop management, water management, soil management, and pest control, utilizing techniques like machine learning and robotics to optimize efficiency [16]. However, the implementation challenges, particularly the high costs and the need for digital literacy among small and medium producers, hinder accessibility and scalability. Similarly, synthetic biology presents innovative strategies, such as improving nitrogen fixation and enhancing food nutrition [17], yet these require substantial research, regulatory approvals, and careful consideration of ecological impacts.
    </p>

  <p>
Despite the potential benefits of these technologies, we chose not to pursue them for our project. The complexity and costs associated with AI technologies present significant barriers to adoption, particularly for smaller agricultural units.

    </p>

</div>


{{subsubheading("Biofuel")}}

<div>
<p>
Artificial bacteria are engineered to convert biomass into biofuels, such as ethanol or butanol, representing a compelling application of synthetic biology [19]. Biomass, which encompasses organic materials derived from plants and agricultural residues, serves as a sustainable feedstock for biofuel production due to its abundance and renewability [20]. However, direct conversion of biomass into biofuels poses significant challenges due to its complex structure, particularly the lignocellulosic components that are difficult to break down [21]. While recent advancements in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology show promise for enhancing biomass degradation through artificial microbial consortia, we ultimately chose not to pursue this application due to uncertainties regarding the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into this process and how it would contribute to overcoming the existing challenges in biofuel production.

  </p>

  <p>
While the potential to create artificial bacteria for biofuel production is intriguing, we felt that the current state of research did not provide a clear pathway for effective implementation.

    </p>
</div>

{{subsubheading("Antibiotic Resistance")}}

<div>

  <p>

  Research has indicated that artificial intelligence [AI] can play a transformative role in the discovery of new antibiotics, particularly against critical pathogens like Acinetobacter baumannii [16]. This finding sparked our interest to further explore this direction, especially given the pressing need to combat antibiotic resistance, which poses significant public health risks. With agriculture accounting for approximately 82% of antibiotic use in Canada, understanding its implications are vital [22]. While we acknowledged the challenges posed by biases in AI models and the potential for unreliable outputs [17], we felt that the urgent need for solutions to antibiotic resistance [ABR] outweighed these concerns. This awareness motivated us to explore a plasmid-based AI approach, which we believe can effectively contribute to addressing the critical issue of antibiotic resistance.

    </p>

  <p>
Current strategies to combat antibiotic resistance (ABR) include the discovery of novel antibiotics through modifications of existing compounds and exploration of unconventional sources [23]. Enhancing the efficacy of current antibiotics involves metabolic stimulation and novel delivery systems [24]. Alternative treatments, such as bacteriophages, anti-biofilm drugs, probiotics, nanomaterials, vaccines, and antibody therapies, are also under investigation [25]. However, antibiotic resistance primarily arises from plasmid-encoded genes that confer resistance to multiple antibiotic classes [26]. Plasmids can be transferred between bacterial cells, allowing the rapid spread of resistance traits [27]. This mechanism of resistance transfer has prompted our focus on the possibility of using our technology to combat this issue in the future.

    </p>

</div>


{{subheading("Assessing Focus Areas: Stakeholder Insights")}}
<div>
  <p>
    After our background research, we decided to engage with individuals from the Ministry of Environment and the healthcare sector to help us choose between bioremediation, wastewater management, and tackling antibiotic resistance. This outreach was essential for understanding the practical challenges and needs associated with each area. By speaking with stakeholders, we aimed to gather insights on current practices and the efficacy of existing solutions. Ultimately, this engagement helped clarify our project focus on antibiotic resistance, as it presented the most pressing public health risks and aligned well with our goal of leveraging plasmid-based AI to combat superbugs.

{{subsubheading("BIKRAMJIT SINGH TOOR")}}

<div>
  
  
  <p><u>Who is this stakeholder?</u></p>

  <p>Bikramjit is an Associate Engineer at the Ministry of Environment in Hamilton, whom we contacted to gain insights into the potential application of our project for bioremediation of wastewater management.</p>
  <p><u>What did they say?</u></p> 
  <p>
    Bikramjit offered valuable insights into the bioremediation and wastewater management landscape in Canada, highlighting current solutions and their challenges. He explained that efforts focus on reducing pollutants and managing waste using methods like constructed wetlands and activated sludge systems, with advanced technologies such as membrane bioreactors and biological nutrient removal systems proving effective. Techniques like phytoremediation and bioaugmentation also enhance pollutant breakdown.
  </p>
  <p>
He pointed out critical issues in wastewater management, starting with aging infrastructure that increases contamination risks. Industrial wastewater from mining, oil, and gas presents another challenge; while vital to Canada's economy, these sectors often lack effective treatment protocols, reflecting the need to balance environmental protection with job preservation.
Stormwater management is also a significant concern, as many treatment plants weren't designed for mixed water streams. Historically, stormwater was discharged untreated, but regulations now require it to go through facilities that often can't handle the increased volume and pollutants like heavy metals and oils, leading to untreated discharges during heavy rains.
    </p>
  <p>
Bikramjit emphasized broader challenges, including high costs, excessive energy consumption, incomplete treatment processes, and bacterial resistance, all of which hinder the adoption of newer technologies.
    </p>
  <p>
When discussing artificial plasmids for bioremediation and wastewater management, he acknowledged their potential but raised concerns about effectiveness, environmental impact, regulatory approval, and monitoring. The use of Genetically Modified Organisms [GMOs] requires rigorous safety trials, and cost remains a significant barrier, as municipalities may hesitate to adopt these solutions due to high expenses. His insights highlight the need for a careful balance between innovation and practical implementation.

  </p>
  
  <p><u>Reflection or Next Steps</u></p>  

  <p>

  Following our meeting with Bikramjit, we recognized that for our plasmid-based solutions to be effective, they must clearly outperform existing methods. This challenge is heightened by ongoing issues with current solutions, including high costs, excessive energy consumption, and incomplete treatment processes.
    </p>
  <p>
We also discussed the reluctance of municipalities to adopt new technologies without compelling, cost-effective evidence of their benefits. This perspective led us to reflect on the practicality of implementing our technology in this sector. Moving forward, we decided to explore alternative future applications for our technology, taking these concerns into account.

{{subheading("HARNESSING ACADEMIC EXPERTISE")}}

{{subsubheading("DR. ALBERT BURGHUISE")}}
<div>
  
  
  <p><u>Who is this stakeholder?</u></p>

  <p>Professor Albert Burghuise is a professor in the Biochemistry Department at Mcgill University, whose research is focused on the development of antimicrobials, antibiotic resistance and crystallography. We reached out to Dr. Burghuise as we wanted his insights on our methods as well as learn more about antibiotic resistance from his perspective.</p>
  <p><u>What did they say?</u></p> 
  <p>
    Professor Burghuise helped us understand the urgent nature of antibiotic resistance describing it second only to climate change. He also helped us understand that perspectives on antibiotic resistance can be subjective and may be underestimated due to the presence of alternative antibiotics. We learnt of how many existing antibiotics are derived from natural compounds that have co-evolved with bacteria for a long time and bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms against them over that time. We were surprised when he shared with us how scientists have observed resistance in places that are untouched by humans. He talked about a study in an isolated cave in Mexico which had never been exposed to antibiotics, however scientists found bacteria that were already resistant to many of our modern drugs. He highlighted that we are not discovering new forms of resistance, rather we are selecting for bacteria that already possess these defenses and that is why resistance seems to appear rapidly after new antibiotics are introduced. 
  </p>
  <p>
Professor. Burghuise also advised that our dataset’s quality and relevance is a crucial aspect of our project and eminent for its success. He also shared some insights to keep in mind for our hardware sample management system and colony detection. He pointed out that the Integration of Internet of Things [IoT] devices could lead to a large amount of data, and how this is an existing problem in hospitals as well. He explained how despite there being a large interest in incorporating IoT, existing systems are not functioning as effectively as desired. We also learnt that there is a concern regarding the information in these systems not being effectively utilized, this issue stemming from data overload, making it challenging for researchers to extract meaningful insights. A suggestion from the professor to address data overload was to develop AI algorithms that can sift through vast amounts of data and identify relevant patterns or insights.
    </p>
 
  
  <p><u>Reflection or Next Steps</u></p>  

  <p>

 Our conversation with Professor Burghuis significantly influenced how we engage stakeholders and approach discussions on antibiotic resistance. We came to understand that the perceived threat of antibiotic resistance is often subjective and can be downplayed due to the availability of alternative antibiotics. However, Professor Burghuis emphasized that antibiotic resistance has deep historical roots—it’s not just a modern issue. This realization is key to how we educate the public, many of whom view antibiotic resistance as a recent development. By highlighting its long-standing presence, we can more effectively convey the urgency of addressing this growing problem and emphasize its pervasive, ongoing impact.

    </p>
  <p>
We also took his concerns about data overload seriously, and subsequently had a discussion with our hardware team about the issue. They explained the challenges they face, particularly with bandwidth limitations and database size. One critical point was that our communication servers have limited bandwidth, and storing large amounts of data isn’t feasible. This led us to rethink our database structures, ensuring they are as compact as possible, storing only essential data such as timestamps to track sample age, without unnecessary information. We also learned that the larger the database, the more expensive and difficult it becomes to maintain, particularly with the microcontrollers we’re using, which have very limited memory capacity.

    </p>

  <p>Regarding the development of AI algorithms, our team admitted that we don’t currently have the capacity to create sophisticated data-sifting tools. There is also a disconnect between industry practitioners and AI experts, as the manufacturing environment is slow to adopt these technologies. Implementing machine learning or AI into our system would require a significant commitment and shift in our current methods, which may not be feasible in the short term.
</p>

  <p>In conclusion, while we continue to navigate the complexities of the data overload challenge, this conversation has significantly clarified our project's direction regarding feedback integration and data management. As we move forward, we acknowledge that enhancing our data storage processes is a longer-term objective. </p>

<div>
  <p><u>Who is this stakeholder?</u></p>

  <p>Dr. Karine Auclair is a professor at McGill University and a Canada Research Chair Antimicrobials. Her research focuses on antibiotic resistance, and she is currently developing a novel treatment for intracellular infections that is free of antibiotics, enhancing the immune system's ability to combat infections. We reached out to her to gain insights into our project, particularly concerning current trends, ethical considerations, and practical challenges in the field of antibiotic resistance</p>
  <p><u>What did they say?</u></p> 
  <p>
    Dr. Auclair highlighted several key areas for us to consider. In terms of current trends, she pointed out that antibiotic resistance continues to evolve rapidly, particularly as researchers turn to artificial intelligence (AI)for designing inhibitors targeting resistant bacterial strains. She emphasized the importance of keeping an eye on medical chemistry developments and their potential applications in our plasmid designs.

  </p>
  <p>
Regarding strategies for plasmid development, Dr. Auclair noted the complexity of plasmid mutation and resistance mechanisms, advising us that the main challenge is the diversity of resistance pathways. This might require the development of multiple systems to address resistance across different bacterial species.
    </p>

  <p>On the topic of ethical challenges, Dr. Auclair observed that research funding often follows economic interests, with more resources directed toward diseases affecting wealthier nations, such as cancer. This makes securing funding for conditions like tuberculosis, which primarily affects less affluent countries, more difficult.
</p>

  <p>She also pointed out several practical challenges, such as the stringent regulations involved in working with pathogenic bacteria, which require certification for handling level 2 bacteria. Additionally, when designing plasmids, she advised us to be mindful of the different parts involved, such as multiple cloning sites.
</p>

  <p>Lastly, she mentioned the influence of new technologies, including natural product biosynthesis and advances in AI and RNA sequencing, which have revolutionized how researchers approach antibiotic resistance today</p>
  
  <p><u>Reflection or Next Steps</u></p>  

  <p>

Dr. Auclair highlighted the complexity of resistance mechanisms and the diversity of resistance pathways among different bacterial species. This insight reinforces our approach of designing plasmids that offer a stronger selective advantage than existing resistance-carrying plasmids. By focusing on creating plasmids that are less metabolically burdensome, easier to replicate, and fundamentally incompatible with target plasmids, we aim to address the multifaceted nature of antibiotic resistance. Our strategy directly responds to the challenge of diversity in resistance mechanisms by ensuring that our plasmids can effectively compete across various bacterial species.

    </p>
  <p>
Dr. Auclair’s insights on funding disparities in antibiotic research emphasizes the need for diverse funding sources. While our project does not focus on diseases like tuberculosis, understanding these challenges is important. Our finance team has effectively secured the necessary resources, allowing us to advance our technology by laying the groundwork to combat antibiotic resistance.

    </p>

  <p>Additionally, her insights into regulatory challenges underscore the importance of compliance. Our wet lab has conducted thorough safety assessments to ensure we meet all necessary certifications and adhere to safety standards in our practices. Overall, our engagement with Dr. Auclair has refined our strategies for addressing antibiotic resistance by highlighting key considerations in plasmid design, funding, and regulatory compliance. We will use these insights to improve our project and ensure it aligns with the ethical and practical aspects of the field. This approach will help us navigate the complexities of antibiotic resistance more effectively.

  <p><u>What did they say?</u></p> 
  <p>
    Dr. Lan provided essential counsel on which specific sequences would be most beneficial to generate and test in vitro. Originally, we were operating with the belief that the model would generate whole plasmids, however, it was quickly realised that this may not be the best approach as this would not help us isolate our observations to any one region of the plasmid. Our initial plan was then to evaluate the role of the origin of replication (oriV) and Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) systems. We discovered, with the help of Dr. Lan, that the oriV would be the most vital sequence to assess.
  </p>
  
  <p><u>Reflections or Next Steps</u></p>  
  <p>
    From our conversations with Dr. Lan, we were able to glean that the oriV is the sequence of the plasmid where we should be focusing our efforts. As such, for the remainder of the project, the oriV was our primary target and we deprioritised evaluation of TA systems.

            <strong>Scientific Challenge vs. Market Process:</strong> They highlighted that individuals possess the autonomy to choose whether or not to utilize these solutions, even if they are released without extensive long-term studies. The speaker argued that this autonomy is crucial, as it allows people to weigh the risks and benefits based on the information available to them at the time.

            <strong>Autonomy and Choice:</strong> Additionally, they pointed out that long-term studies cannot guarantee safety or efficacy for every individual. Instead, real-world usage can provide invaluable data that contributes to the optimization of these solutions. By allowing the public to access these treatments, we foster an environment where feedback can drive continuous improvement, ultimately offering better options for those in need.

    Reflecting on these diverse perspectives has helped us better understand the ethical implications of our project. Our debate highlighted the importance of transparency regarding the technology we are developing. By discussing the potential benefits and risks of AI-generated solutions, we aim to address public concerns and build trust.
Collaborating with experts like Dr. Koester and Dr. Herington has deepened our understanding of historical injustices and ethical considerations in antibiotic resistance. These discussions emphasize our commitment to responsible innovation and informed consent.

  <p>
Our wiki has been fully transparent about our work, and we remain committed to keeping our stakeholders informed. We've also developed educational materials, such as our article with the Science Communication Club [SCC], to further engage the public. Insights from the debate will guide our long-term goals, ensuring that we prioritize public safety and autonomy as we work on effective solutions for antibiotic resistance.
