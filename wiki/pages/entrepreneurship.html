    About Us
  </h2>-->

  <p>
    At the forefront of biotech innovation, our iGEM team has translated our developed foundational models into an actionable, groundbreaking startup with the potential to revolutionize the field. Through rigorous market and stakeholder research, coupled with extensive mentorship, we have pinpointed a transformative application positioned to create significant impact. Our entrepreneurial journey has been furthered by participation in two prestigious incubator programs: the University of Toronto's flagship incubator (NEST 2024 – Hatchery) and the iGEM Startups Venture Creation Labs. Achieving the "Go-to-Market" stage at UofT and securing an opportunity to present at the Bioinnovation Fair in Paris exemplify our progress. With a comprehensive business plan and 24-month cash flow projections crafted under the guidance of Toronto-based venture capitalists, our roadmap spans from pre-seed funding to Series B in a span of 10 years. By engaging deeply with both academic and industry leaders, we have honed our value proposition, ensuring that our innovations align closely with market needs and opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, you’ll find a detailed look into our comprehensive business plan,
    demonstrating the feasibility, scalability, and innovation of our approach.
    Our plan includes a transparent product development timeline, outlining the
    required resources and potential risks. We highlight our team’s skills and
    capabilities, along with the involvement of key stakeholders crucial for
    bringing our solution to market. Additionally, we assess the long-term
    impacts—both positive and negative—and provide insights into our target
    customers and their unmet needs.

        The Problem
      </h2>
      <p>
        As of now, the development of a phage therapy involves hundreds of repetitions of a
        scientist preparing wet lab procedure, preparing reagents, culturing an antibiotic
        resistant bacteria, isolating phage, co-incubating the phage and bacteria, and measuring
        the phage’s parasitization of the bacteria. With each step being prone to failure, the
        entire process is highly costly and takes months to complete.

      <p>
        Plasmid.AI intends to utilize the power of large language models to expedite preclinical phage discovery.
        By simulating phage-bacteria interactions in silico, our model would identify phage therapy candidates at
        a fraction of time and resource-intensive wet lab work.
