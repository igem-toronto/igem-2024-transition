    <p>
      At the forefront of biotech innovation, our iGEM team has translated our
      developed foundational models into an actionable, groundbreaking startup with
      the potential to revolutionize the field. Through rigorous market and stakeholder
      research, coupled with extensive mentorship, we have pinpointed a transformative
      application positioned to create significant impact. Our entrepreneurial journey
      has been furthered by participation in two prestigious incubator programs: the
      University of Toronto's flagship incubator (NEST 2024 – Hatchery) and the iGEM
      Startups Venture Creation Labs. Achieving the "Go-to-Market" stage at UofT and
      securing an opportunity to present at the Bioinnovation Fair in Paris exemplify
      our progress. With a comprehensive business plan and 24-month cash flow projections
      crafted under the guidance of Toronto-based venture capitalists, our roadmap spans
      from pre-seed funding to Series B in a span of 10 years. By engaging deeply with
      both academic and industry leaders, we have honed our value proposition, ensuring
      that our innovations align closely with market needs and opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, you’ll find a detailed look into our comprehensive business plan,
      demonstrating the feasibility, scalability, and innovation of our approach.
      Our plan includes a transparent product development timeline, outlining the
      required resources and potential risks. We highlight our team’s skills and
      capabilities, along with the involvement of key stakeholders crucial for
      bringing our solution to market. Additionally, we assess the long-term
      impacts—both positive and negative—and provide insights into our target
      customers and their unmet needs.

        Through direct engagement with academic leaders, biotechnology KOLs, and our mentors, we've identified and secured our first customers. 
        We're proud to announce that we were approached by Tetsuwan Scientific, a San Francisco-based company, wanting to integrate our platform with their workflow.
        Our first customers have sent us a proposal for their project, and we're awaiting for our technology to be developed further in order to complete this project. 
        Our future customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that conduct preclinical discovery as part of their pipeline. Our technology flawlessly integrates 
        and expedites the preclinical discovery process, and projected to cut preclinical costs by ~70%.

        We've also worked hand-in-hand with AI researchers to ensure that the resources needed are realistic.
        We've worked closely with mentors to identify key market & product risks, and we've worked closely with our HP team to identify societal risks.

        <p><b>Seed Stage: </b> We aim to undertake the appropriate legal entity and trademark registrations in Canada and the United States. We aim to on board AI scientists and bioinformatic specialists, and develop models to target carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli.</i> This initial milestone serves as a Proof of Concept, and addresses an urgent need for a treatment involving this strain.</p>
        <p><b>Series A:</b> Our plan to secure $15 million allows us to expand our Proof of Concept to other bacterial strains, aligning with the typical expansion plans for an early-stage biotech company. Given that we've made it to the "Go-to-market" stage at UofT's flagship incubator, we expect to be able to hit this milestone in the next 5-8 years.</p>
        <p><b>Series B:</b> Depending on the success of previous rounds, we aim to raise additional money as needed for the development of additional models tailored to specific bacterial strains. This long-term funding strategy allows us to maintain competitiveness by acquiring necessary R&D resources.</p>
        <p><b>Exit:</b> Our structure and long-term plan is to integrate into a company's existing pipeline. Once our MVP has been validated to work, we aim to exit via a Merger & Acqusition (M&A).</p>

We require reagents, equipment, and lab space in order to validate the models' results. We intend to source the reagents and equipment from ThermoFisher and other local suppliers. We intend to obtain lab space through SpinUp, a Toronto-based incubator with lab space for early-stage startups.</p>

        <p>We are currently collaborating with key partners to advance our R&D. Our partnership with the Garton Lab at the University of Toronto provides us with dry lab expertise and computational data.

          Artificial intelligence is a cutting-edge technology that has gained great attention in the
          world for its potential and seemingly endless applications. Using artificial intelligence to
          design genetic codes has definite concerns in affecting evolution and may potentially be a
          force contributing to natural selection, in which we see increasing pressure for regulations
          and legislation on data collection, utilization and generation. Our Human Practices (HP)
          subteam has done a detailed analysis on the effects of a project on relevant stakeholders
          across biotech industries, ethical practices, healthcare industries and synthetic biology
          laboratories alike. In particular, through discussion with bioethicist Dr. Jim Shaw, McGill
          chemistry professor Dr. Karine Auclair, biosecurity expert Dr. Jonathan Herington and others,
          Plasmid.AI can incorporate feedback from the leaders in the industry to create a well-poised
          product. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our stance is to see artificial intelligence as a neutral tool that could both benefit or
          damage to society, depending on the intent of its user. With the growing stress from
          antimicrobial resistance, our team see it as an inevitable advancement to use artificial
          intelligence to create effective weapons against bacteria, and to save the lives of millions.
          For more information on our analysis on long-term and short term impacts of our fully
          developed solution, please visit the Human Practices section of our wiki.
