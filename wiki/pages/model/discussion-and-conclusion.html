        The results of our plasmid generation model demonstrate both the potential and limitations of combining
        computational approaches with experimental validation in synthetic biology. Our tokenizer proved to be highly
        effective in improving our training metrics and retaining biological relevance. Our validation pipeline,
        particularly in ori alignment, allows for nuance by searching beyond high alignment metrics for the presence of
        important motifs. Nevertheless, the predominantly negative alignment scores for the Class B plasmid elements
        highlight the complexity of generating biologically functional plasmids solely through computational methods.
        These results suggest that while our model captures general plasmid structures, there are gaps in replicating
        the nuanced sequence variations required for specific functional elements. This underscores the need for more
        diverse reference sequences and improved fine-tuning of the model to capture subtle sequence motifs. The
        iterative wet lab-dry lab collaboration has proven invaluable in this regard; initial dry lab predictions
        identified promising sequences, which were then refined based on wet lab feedback. For instance, the decision to
        focus on Class B plasmids for wet lab testing was driven by their simpler replication machinery, which is easier
        to validate experimentally compared to Class A plasmids with more complex requirements. This collaborative cycle
        between computational generation and experimental validation not only enhances the accuracy of generated
        plasmids but also accelerates the overall engineering cycle. Some key limitations and next steps are discussed
        below.

    {{ subsubsubheading("Limited Data For Model Training") }}
    <div>
        <p>
            The scarcity and complexity of plasmid sequence data present significant challenges for machine learning models
            like our Mamba2. Plasmids are typically long sequences, but relatively few have been fully sequenced, resulting
            in a limited dataset for training. Moreover, their modular nature, consisting of various functional elements
            combined in different ways, further complicates the learning process. To address these limitations, we
            implemented several data augmentation techniques. We employed random circular permutations to simulate the
            circular nature of plasmids and to increase sequence diversity. Additionally, we included sub plasmid sequences
            of varying lengths, effectively breaking down the complex structures into more manageable segments. These
            strategies not only expanded our training dataset but also helped our model better capture the modular and
            circular characteristics of plasmids, improving its ability to generate biologically plausible sequences despite
            the initial data constraints.

    {{ subsubsubheading("Motif Annotation and Discovery") }}
    <div>
        <p>
            There is limited data available on relevant motifs. Particularly, protein binding motifs are difficult to
            annotate. MEME only discovers motifs but it does not determine if any of the discovered motifs are known binding
            sites. We can use MEME Suite’s FIMO tool {{ cite('Bailey2015' )}} to scan the sequences for occurrences of the
            discovered motifs and
            compare them against known binding site databases to identify potential binding sites; however, this requires
            supplying a sequence of known binding site motifs. Currently, we are unable to find a database of replication
            protein binding motifs. To overcome this limitation, in the current pipeline, we prioritize features that are
            more likely to be conserved, such as RNA II molecules, AT-rich regions, etc.

    {{ subsubsubheading("Complex ori Machinery") }}
    <div>
        <p>
            The ori is an intricate and interdependent network of smaller, essential components, all of which must be both
            present and functionally matched for successful plasmid replication. Because wildtype plasmids already possess
            these configurations, much of the intricacies involved in how these elements interact remain poorly studied. The
            challenge lies in the relational nature of these components—each element is not just independently necessary but
            must also coordinate with others in a specific spatial and temporal context. This complexity makes it difficult
            to experimentally disentangle the contributions of individual motifs, further compounded by a lack of
            comprehensive datasets that characterize these interactions in diverse bacterial systems.

    {{ subsubsubheading("Relational Challenge") }}
    <div>
        <p>
            The relational challenge is especially problematic when attempting to generate or engineer new plasmid oris
            through computational models. The necessity for these components to be contextually correct, not just
            individually present, creates difficulties in ensuring functional replication in synthetic constructs. Despite
            these challenges, understanding and replicating these complex interdependencies is key to designing new plasmids
            with predictable behavior, and more research is needed to systematically explore how these components co-evolve
            and function together.

{{ subsubheading("Next Steps") }}
<div>
    <p>
        Building upon our current progress, our next step in plasmid generation will focus on developing a more
        context-aware model that can better capture the intricate relationships between different plasmid elements. We
        envision implementing a hierarchical generation approach, where the model first learns to generate a high-level
        plasmid architecture, including the relative positions and sizes of key functional elements such as ori regions,
        coding sequences, and regulatory elements. This skeletal structure would then guide the generation of specific
        sequences for each element, ensuring better coherence and biological plausibility. Additionally, we plan to
        incorporate attention mechanisms that allow the model to explicitly consider long-range dependencies within the
        plasmid sequence, potentially improving the generation of complex regulatory networks and compatible functional
        elements. This advanced generation strategy aims to produce more holistic and functionally viable plasmid
        designs, bridging the gap between computational predictions and biological reality.

        Developing more sophisticated alignment and motif discovery algorithms, potentially incorporating machine
        learning-based sequence alignment methods, would enhance the accuracy of in silico validation, especially for
        distinguishing between complex plasmid types. Expanding the in silico validation pipeline to include more
        comprehensive functional assays, such as simulation of plasmid replication and expression dynamics, would
        provide deeper insights into the biological relevance of generated sequences. Eventually, we hope to validate
        entire plasmids beyond oris, and beyond this, other sequences such as bacterial chromosomes and phage genomes.

{{ subheading("Conclusion") }}
<div>
    <p>
        The development of our plasmid generation model highlights several critical advancements and challenges in the
        field of synthetic biology. Our use of BPE for tokenizing plasmid sequences has proven effective in compressing
        extensive genetic information while preserving biological relevance, enabling efficient processing of large
        plasmids. The Mamba model’s state-space architecture further supports this by handling long-range dependencies
        more effectively than traditional transformer models, thereby capturing both local and global features essential
        for accurate plasmid generation. Our two-phase training process—pretraining on a broad dataset and fine-tuning
        on specific plasmid classes—strikes a balance between generalizability and specificity, enhancing the model’s
        ability to generate biologically plausible sequences tailored to specific research needs. However, challenges in
        the in silico validation process, particularly in the classification and alignment of Class A and Class B
        plasmids, reveal the need for more diverse training data and improved sequence alignment techniques. Preliminary
        results indicate that while Class B plasmid generation shows potential, further refinement in motif discovery
        and alignment pipelines is required to increase the biological validity and experimental relevance of the
        generated plasmids. Our iterative approach, combining computational generation with wet lab validation, enables
        a strong foundational solution for generating novel bioloigcally relevant plasmids.
