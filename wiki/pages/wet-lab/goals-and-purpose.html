  <p>
    The main goal of the wet lab team is to test and validate, <i>in vitro</i>, the AI-generated plasmid parts the dry lab team
    creates. Validating each individual plasmid part allows us to determine with more granularity which specific
    AI-plasmid components are functional.
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve this goal, we utilize a pipeline in which we assemble the AI-parts into a known plasmid backbone using
    Golden Gate Assembly (GGA – a high-throughput transgene insertion method), and test the viability of the AI-parts
    using bacterial growth assays. Finally, we sequence the new working plasmid parts to confirm successful propagation
    of the AI-parts, such as the origin of vegetative replication (<i>oriV</i>) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). These
    developments provide a proof-of-concept for the tractability of synthesizing plasmids de novo using dry lab’s
    machine learning framework, which sets the path forward to ultimately create fine-tuned plasmids to tackle
    antibiotic resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wet lab pipeline for validating various AI-plasmid parts, in particular the <i>oriV</i> and ARGs, is described in
    detail in the following sections. Thus far, the wet lab team has synthesized and tested novel <i>oriV</i>s generated by dry
    lab, of which samples 741, 9371, 5276, 5727, and 4089 have been determined as functional.
